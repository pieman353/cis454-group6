This website must be run on a local web server.
However, it does NOT require a local MySQL database.

1. Download XAMPP from apachefriends.org (Apache-based web server software).
2. The only components that must be installed are Apache and PHP. You may also
choose the default installation, which installs all components, if you wish.
3. After installation, navigate to the XAMPP root directory (in Windows, this is
C:/xampp/htdocs). The location of the htdocs may differ depending on your system,
but it will always be called htdocs.
4. Copy the cis454-group6 folder into the htdocs folder (so that the directory is 
now xampp/htdocs/cis454-group).
5. Open the XAMPP Control Panel.
6. Next to the Apache module, click start.
7. Open any web browser and type localhost/cis454-group6/FrontPage.html
8. You can now browse the site normally, using the back and forward navigation buttons
on your browser.
